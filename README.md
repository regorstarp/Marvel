# Marvel

## Setup

To get started, clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/regorstarp/Marvel.git
```

The api keys are managed by [cocoapods-keys](https://github.com/orta/cocoapods-keys) so you will need to install it. 
```
gem install cocoapods-keys
```

Then, run the following command inside the git directory to install all the required pods:

```
pod install
```

After running the command you will be prompted to input both the public and private keys for the marvel api.   
Go to https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started for more info about obtaining api access.
